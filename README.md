# CONTACT US FORM

Using External Libraries
Working with forms

## Task:
- Create a Contact Us form that allows users to send you a message to make inquiries. The form should have the following fields:
1. Name (required)
2. Email (required and should be validated)
3. Subject (optional)
4. Message (required)
## Product Requirements 
- The name, email, and message fields are required.
- If fields are empty, display errors under each field
- The email field should be validated as an email. If the email entered is invalid, display an appropriate error under the email field.
- On successful submission, display a message at the top of your form indicating that the submission was successful.
- On successful submission, the form fields should be reset.
- If there is an error during the submission, display an error message at the top of the form informing the user that the submission wasn’t successful.
## Technical Requirements
- The form should be built using React
- You can use component libraries (MUI, ChakraUI, React-bootstrap) to build your form if you desire.
- You can choose to implement your form using third-party libraries like Formik if you desire.
- You can use Axios or fetch() for this assignment to post the form data to the API
## Optional Requirements
- On clicking on submit, add a loading indicator in the button to show that the form is submitting

## Resources
- Here is the API endpoint to send the user’s data to:
[typicode](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/tundeojediran/contacts-api-server/inquiries)

- The data to post to the API endpoint should be in this format:
``css
{
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Tun Oje",
    "email": "test2@test.com",
    "subject": "test2 subject",
    "message": "test2 message"
}
``
- where:
- id - is the unique id for the data being posted. Use a third-party library like nanoid to generate this random id
- name - is the name of the user
- email - is the email of the user
- subject - is the subject of the inquiry 
- message - is the content of the inquiry

## Please note:
Your work should not be in the main branch but in a separate branch with your chosen name.
On completing the implementation, create a pull request (PR) pointing your working branch to the main branch.
